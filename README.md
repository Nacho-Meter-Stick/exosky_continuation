# Exosky
This was a project created at the Space Apps 2024 Hackathon.

## Our Challenge
> "What would the night sky look like if you were standing on one of the many exoplanets discovered by astronomers and space missions? The list of 5500+ exoplanets at the NASA Exoplanet Archive can be combined with the latest star catalogs to translate the location and brightness of millions or even billions of stars to another perspective. From that perspective, anyone could use their imagination to draw constellations, much like our ancestors did on Earth thousands of years ago. Your challenge is to develop an app or interface for students that allows them to choose an exoplanet and then either display an interactive star chart or export a high-quality image for printing or viewing on a computer or virtual reality display, where they can draw and name constellations." - NASA Space Apps Challenge

## Our Project!
  Ever since the dawn of civilization humans have looked at the sky and dreamed of what's above. From the surface of our planet, it is easy to imagine that the sky is a dynamic curtain; an absolute. The night sky is something that is familiar, but only from the perspective of Earth. Our project aims to answer the question: "What would the night sky look like on other planets?" If you were to look up at the sky on an exoplanet what would you see? Our program allows users to see star charts from over 3 thousand exoplanets, and to create their own constellations from those star maps.
