# Exosky
This was a project created at the Space Apps 2024 Hackathon.

Ever since the dawn of civilization humans have looked at the sky and dreamed of what's above. From the surface of our planet, it is easy to imagine that the sky is a dynamic curtain; an absolute. The night sky is something that is familiar, but only from the perspective of Earth. The "Exosky Explorer" aims to simulate an experience similar to our distant ancestors by generating a unique and interactive night sky view from the perspective of an exoplanet. Our program generates an accurate star chart based on any selected exoplanet's position in our galaxy and allows the user to create their own constellations from those star charts.

## Our Challenge
> "What would the night sky look like if you were standing on one of the many exoplanets discovered by astronomers and space missions? The list of 5500+ exoplanets at the NASA Exoplanet Archive can be combined with the latest star catalogs to translate the location and brightness of millions or even billions of stars to another perspective. From that perspective, anyone could use their imagination to draw constellations, much like our ancestors did on Earth thousands of years ago. Your challenge is to develop an app or interface for students that allows them to choose an exoplanet and then either display an interactive star chart or export a high-quality image for printing or viewing on a computer or virtual reality display, where they can draw and name constellations." - NASA Space Apps Challenge
